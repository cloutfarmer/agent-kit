# Changelog

## 1.0.1

- `pr-triage` no longer treats tests left to CI as "could not verify", and doesn't try
  to run them.
- Only a breaking public API change is a design trigger by default, and a trigger needs
  a clear match. In testing, the same additive export got different labels on two runs.

## 1.0.0

First version: `adopt`, `check` and `sync`, the `core`, `review` and `triage`
modules, and the standard docs templates.
